Hi, this is Dominik and that is my:

# Official RCDevs OpenOTP Credential Provider  #

This Credential Provider (CP) aims to improve the overall security of the Windows logon process by adding an authenticator. The additional authenticator is "Something That You Have" and consists of the validation of an one-time password (OTP).

The CP enables you to use _RCDevs' OpenOTP Authentication Server_ to logon to your Windows user account. It acts as an additional security layer beside your user password.

You can use tokens generated by a token device (e.g. _YubiKey_) or software token (e.g. _Google Authenticator_, _Mobile-OTP/mOTP_), but tokens could also be send to you by eMail, SMS or using a pre-generated token list.
See this lists for all compatible [software](http://www.rcdevs.com/tokens/?type=software) and [hardware](http://www.rcdevs.com/tokens/?type=hardware) tokens.

This CP works in local and domain environments. For use in local enviroments leave the _Default Domain_ field empty during installation. For **local-only** use-cases see [below](#>_For_local-only_use:.md).

See http://www.rcdevs.com/ . It's **free for up to 25 users**!

**Requirements:**
  * Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows Server 2008 R 2 +
  * Administrator privileges
  * You need _OpenOTP Authentication Server_ and _WebADM_ by [RCDevs](http://www.rcdevs.com/). See their [Downloads](http://www.rcdevs.com/downloads/)-section > Software Packages.
  * Configured user account(s) in your _WebADM_'s LDAP
  * **To logon you NEED TO HAVE an internet connection / instance of _OpenOTP Authentication Server_ running in your network!**

### Windows Safe Mode ###
By default, Windows _does not load_ custom credential providers (like _OpenOTP CP_) in safe mode.
If you really want to know how to enable _OpenOTP CP_ in safe mode, reading our UseInSafeMode wiki page may help you.
